=> {}); -> Registers an event handler with this object, so other parts of the app know when something changes\r\n        trigger(eventName:string):void; -> Triggers an event to tell other parts of the app that someting has changed\r\n        fetch(): Promise; -> Fetches some data from the server about a particular user\r\n        save (): Promise; -> Saves some data about this user to the
